# hive_assignment
Technical assignment for Hive Helsinki internship, a tool that will help find students who have done "bad evaluations" during a certain specified time using the internal [42API](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/). 
My notes and to-do are [here](https://github.com/ehalmkro/hive_assignment/projects/1).
